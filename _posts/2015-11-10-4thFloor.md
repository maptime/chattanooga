November 10 2015- Come hear about OpenStreetMap and MaptimeCHA.Several of of us have been mapping Chattanooga in OpenStreetMap and we would like to recruit more people. What is OpenStreetMap? Come to the meetup and learn. We want to teach everyone how to do this so you can go back and map your neighborhood. We want everyone - Male and Female - blue, green, and purple - young and old.
